You can see more about the company here: <a href=\"http://courseconcierge.com\">http://courseconcierge.com</a> </div><div><br></div><div>We’re starting a new venture with one of our clients, who is a prominent Norwegian personality. We’re going places, and you will be working with the three of us co-founders.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m based in London. Till is based in Los Angeles. Our third partner is based in Norway (though frequently travelling). Requirement: our ideal candidate, thus, has perfect written and spoken English and Norwegian.</div><div><br></div><div>A passage that inspires us, in how we like to run companies – from Marc Andreessen (of a16z):</div><div><br></div><div><em>‘We had decided one of the values of the firm is respect for the people we work with. And part of that respect is, we don’t drop balls. We respond quickly and we get back to people in a specific period of time. We use the old J.P. Morgan saying of “first class business in a first class way”.  If you contact us, you’re going to get a response. If we commit to doing something, we’re going to do that thing.’</em></div><div><br></div><div>In helping us at all times adhere to this, your duties will include:</div><div><br></div><div>- Itinerary planning for productions. This includes both travel management, and booking locations to shoot, getting permits (for filming), managing licensing requests and the like. The last trip I took to the US, I changed my itinerary five times mid-trip. This is typical. We need someone okay with this – and who can still help ensure things run to schedule.</div><div><br></div><div>- Management of personal inboxes – screening and responding to emails. Dealing with sponsor requests; being able to decline opportunities in a polite and professional (though occasionally <em>firm</em>) way. Supreme attention to detail and writing etiquette in this. (Some of this being in Norwegian.) We want someone who, even in their own private WhatsApp messages, upholds a near-flawless level of grammar.</div><div><br></div><div>- Occasional gift buying for team members and important people in our lives. And management of personal things for us: medical appointments, and helping plan fun weekend activities.</div><div><br></div><div>- Once having proved yourself, the potential to mastermind and project-manage entire team/company/partner retreats. (Our last was a three-day ski/snowboard holiday in Saint-Gervais, Mont-Blanc.)</div><div><br></div><div>We want someone who is relentlessly resourceful in overcoming obstacles. When everyone is telling you ‘No, this can’t be done’ , you – through a mix of creative thinking, perseverance, and charm – find a way to make it happen. Initiative, and you don’t give up.</div><div><br></div><div>*</div><div>The position will start at 25 hours per week, and pay will be set at a competitive rate. Inside six–12 months, the role will likely be nearer full-time.</div><div><br></div><div>This position is entirely remote. You can work your own hours. (This is not a conventional 9–5.) Though we tend to think, for time zones, the ideal candidate will live in Europe.</div><div><br></div><div>To apply, please write to <a href=\"mailto:execad@courseconcierge.com\">execad@courseconcierge.com</a> with a short cover letter noting why you think you would be a good fit. Please do not send a CV. (We don’t care where anyone went to university – or even that you went at all.) But please <em>do</em> include a single attachment of one travel itinerary you have put together for something. This can be anything at all (personal or professional). We just want a clear example in presentation of how you’ve organised some kind of trip.</div><div><br></div><div>We won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will be in touch within two weeks to discuss next steps.

Our largest sites: <a href=\"https://www.catster.com/\">Catster.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dogster.com/\">Dogster.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hepper.com/\">Hepper.com</a>, and <a href=\"https://petkeen.com/\">PetKeen.com</a> are visited by more than 60 million pet lovers every year, and we’re undergoing rapid growth.</div><div>\n<br>Our media sites are all built on WordPress, and our own cat furniture e-commerce brand, Hepper, is running on WooCommerce.</div><div>\n<br>In this position you would be the lead web developer, which will consist of fixing the issues that come up, proactively keeping our sites secure, and building new things.<br><br>\n</div><div>We’re a 100% remote company so you’d have the freedom to work from anywhere. It's a full-time position (40 hours a week), yet you get to plan your own schedule and work whenever you want.

The webdev department needs to become kickass, so this position will definitely require working on some weekends.<br><br>\n</div><div>💻 We’re looking for a fullstack developer. However, for this position, <strong>it is much more important to be great at backend coding than frontend design</strong>. Our sites already look great on the front end, but it’s mainly on the back end where a lot of work needs to be done.

It’s therefore important you are excited about hiring, managing, and doing code reviews with developers. We can help teach you the skills to hire and manage developers, though, you must be excited about this for this to work.<br>- Developing new tools and software that help millions of pet lovers every month (could for example be to develop a Puppy Weight Chart Tool / Calculator that helps pet owners predict how fast, and how big their dog will grow)</div><div>- Developing, testing, and maintaining new features and solutions for our WordPress sites for desktop and mobile browsers that are optimized for high traffic.<br>- Create, review, and update technical documentation such as contributing to our development processes, QA procedures, and technical planning</div><div>- Communicating and supporting our content and marketing departments with dev/IT requests, troubleshooting, fixing bugs<br>- Performing scheduled and non-scheduled maintenance and security updates on our WordPress sites</div><div>- Always proactively being on top of things and securing and protecting our WordPress sites from hackers and malware, as well as eliminating risks<br>- Be informed of relevant new technology and best practices<br><br>\n</div><div><strong>You are expected to have:</strong></div><ul>\n<li>Experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, and PHP</li>\n<li>Experience with MySQL and managing databases</li>\n<li>Experience with WordPress development (e.g. themes, hooks, filters, plugin API, etc)</li>\n<li>Experience with build tools like Webpack or ViteJS</li>\n<li>Experience with Composer and a basic understanding of autoloading, dependency management, and dependency injection</li>\n<li>Experience with SSH and comfortable with basic terminal usage</li>\n<li>Experience with Git (and GitHub)</li>\n<li>Troubleshooting abilities (ie include finding CSS and JavaScript conflicts using browser developer tools, navigating codebases in theme and plugins, and determining whether a plugin or theme code could be causing a code conflict)</li>\n<li>The ability to take a project on your own and get it done before the deadline</li>\n<li>Strong communication skills. This is a MUST as we work remotely. (most of our communication is written in Slack with occasional calls)</li>\n</ul><div><br></div><div>\n<strong>The Type of Person We Would Love For This Role<br></strong><br>\n</div><div>—&gt; You are a dependable, friendly communicator</div><div>—&gt; You’re passionate about solving problems with smart and elegant programming solutions. Your code is clean, understandable, and well-commented</div><div>—&gt; You’re a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through to completion.</div><div>—&gt; You have the curiosity and desire to learn and grow your skills and discover new modern practices and follow the latest trends in WordPress</div><div>—&gt; You’re able to juggle around and work on different projects and side tasks on a weekly basis. While we wish we could focus on one thing for weeks at a time to make it perfect, that’s often not the reality in a competitive market.<br><br>\n</div><div><strong>Benefits/Perks when working at Pangolia</strong></div><div>🌏 Work from anywhere (we’re 100% remote)</div><div>💡 Work with a hard-working, talented team of kickass people</div><div>🕑 Flexible work hours, you get to plan your own schedule and work whenever you want</div><div>🌴 Company retreats! (we just did a company retreat in Phuket, Thailand!)</div><div>💰 Your payment is paid biweekly (You’re paid every two weeks)</div><div>\n<strong>💻</strong> We encourage you to find a working environment that suits your needs the best if working from home every single day isn’t for you.

In other words: this role has a lot of freedom for you to work in the way that you think is best for the company. Simon and the team do not micromanage and have no interest in doing so.</li>\n<li>You’re also responsible for maintaining the Github repository of the project you’re working on, committing/pushing/documenting your changes, commenting on your code, and writing SOPs or technical documentation (if necessary). It doesn’t have to be pages long and can be very short and concise. But, as a developer, it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates' time.</li>\n<li>There must be some overlap in our working hours so you can respond to urgent requests (if any) or chat with your manager or any of our departments on demand if they have an IT question. This means that some extra tasks may arise during the week.</li>\n<li>You might have a day where one of our team members needs something urgent and needs it done the same or the next day, which can be valuable to the company, or a major issue needs to be fixed ASAP, in which case you might have to drop what you're working on and work on that. If your main project's deadline cannot be met because of this (which is understandable), you should be able to communicate this on time.</li>\n<li>However, most of the time you are able to work on your main projects in solitary. We understand that developers need complete focus. You can also chat and ask questions in our Slack channels.</li>\n</ul><div><strong>The team (and our work culture)</strong></div><div>You’ll get to be part of a 100% remote company consisting of a diverse group of 80 talented individuals from all over the world.

We dream big, and our mission is to become the biggest, most helpful pet company in the world.<br><br>\n</div><div>You’ll get to be part of a company that’s undergoing hyper-growth, and the fast-paced work environment that comes with it.<br><br>\n</div><div>And we’ve managed to grow at a healthy pace without ever sacrificing our culture and values.<br><br>\n</div><div>Our company culture is focused on work and collaboration, but also being open to the casual humor and chatter that makes us get to know each other.<br><br>\n</div><div>We value the freedom of being able to work from anywhere, trust, and collaboration.</div>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/pangolia-lead-wordpress-developer-for-fast-growing-pet-company-remote-worldwide\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/pangolia-lead-wordpress-developer-for-fast-growing-pet-company-remote-worldwide</a></p>\n","pubDate":"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 06:38:24 +0000","expires_at":"Sun, 31 Dec 2023 06:38:24 +0000","link":"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/pangolia-lead-wordpress-developer-for-fast-growing-pet-company-remote-worldwide"},{"title":"Lemon.io: Senior Full-stack Developer","region":"Latin America Only","category":"Full-Stack Programming","type":"Full-Time","description":"\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Kyiv, Ukraine\n    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://lemon.io\">https://lemon.io</a>\n</p>\n\n<div>\n<br>Are you a talented senior developer looking for a remote job that lets you show your skills and get a better compensation and career growth?

We do ask that all employees schedule their work days to have at least a five hour overlap with 9:00 am - 5:00 pm eastern time (EDT/EST), but how that ends up working out is different for everyone. All that matters is that your team can count on you to attend meetings and meet project deadlines.<br><br>\n</div><div>We heavily utilize Slack and Jira for frequent daily communication. Other tools in our belt include Google Apps (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.), Confluence, Harvest, and more that are specific to specialized teams.

This is a full-time position that can be in our office (Los Angeles/Santa Monica) or fully remote (US only at this time). We are looking for engineers with two or more years of full stack web application development experience. Starting salary range is 100-150k depending on experience. Learn more about OpenPlay at: <a href=\"https://openplay.co/\">www.openplay.co</a><br><br>\n</div><div><strong><br>Engineering at OpenPlay</strong></div><div>\n<br>Thousands of record labels around the world use our flagship product OpenPlay Music to manage and distribute their music. We work with the major US record distributors and many independents. We are onboarding another 300+ record labels this year and we need to grow our engineering team to handle increasing demand for both client services and new product growth. OpenPlay is a bootstrapped, growing company started in 2013.<br><br>\n</div><div>In your role at OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 4-6 other engineers and a UX/visual designer to design, build, review, deploy, maintain, and iterate on OpenPlay’s web applications. We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement. Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting, a daily engineering meeting, choose what to work on, and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done, collaborating as needed.</div><div>\n<br>You will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team, which include:</div><ul>\n<li>Participating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming week.</li>\n<li>Participating in daily engineering-only meetings (roughly 30min) where the team collaborates on technical decisions, resolving issues, and reducing complexity.</li>\n<li>Writing tests: we write mostly full-stack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the code.</li>\n<li>Writing application code: mostly Ruby, some HTML, some Javascript. CSS is mostly handled by visual design.</li>\n<li>Reviewing code: We do round-robin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer. You’ll take turns reviewing everyone else’s code and they will take turns reviewing yours.</li>\n<li>Deploying code: We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day. Deployments are automated with lots of fail-safes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible.</li>\n<li>Maintaining code: Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions, techniques, and technologies. You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug.</li>\n</ul><div>\n<br>Some things you won’t do:</div><ul>\n<li>Estimating work to be done. Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly.</li>\n<li>Reporting progress. Work is done when it’s deployed. Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex.</li>\n<li>Stakeholder meetings. While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming. We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead, allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered.</li>\n</ul><div>As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them. We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools, processes, and conventions. You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like, and we would like to learn from your experience, but the degree to which you participate is up to you.<br><br>\n</div><div><strong><br>Experience we’re looking for</strong></div><div>\n<br>The main thing we’re looking for is experience in full stack web application development. Specifically, we think you’ll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a database-centric web application to be a productive member of your team. In particular you should have experience with:</div><ul>\n<li>Relational database concepts such as: foreign keys, indexes, normalization and denormalization, SQL queries.</li>\n<li>Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework. We don’t use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions. We’ve had success bringing people on from Python/Django so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit.</li>\n<li>Some familiarity with Javascript. We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small client-side components.</li>\n<li>Writing tests. We practice integration-test-heavy outside-in test-driven development. If you’ve practiced any sort of test-driven development you will pick it up fast.</li>\n</ul><div>In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done <em>well</em>. Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad. We collaborate frequently and we don’t always get things right on the first try, but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things <em>well</em> to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team.<br><br>\n</div><div><strong><br>Technologies we use</strong></div><ul>\n<li>OpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets. At present we have plenty of room to scale.</li>\n<li>Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built on Sequel (ORM), Sinatra, and HAML. If you’re familiar with Rails (or similar MVC frameworks) you’ll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here.</li>\n<li>On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience, most of which ultimately requests updates from the server.</li>\n<li>There are currently around 2500 full-stack browser-based integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output. CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>We do things typical of web applications like:<ul>\n<li>Store data in, and query from, a relational database (PostgreSQL)</li>\n<li>Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)</li>\n<li>Handle slow tasks with background processing</li>\n<li>Push asynchronous updates to clients with WebSockets</li>\n<li>Export XML files, PDFs, CSVs, Excel spreadsheets, and other formats that just won’t seem to go away</li>\n<li>Import data from Excel spreadsheets, (music-industry standard) DDEX XML, JSON, and various other sources</li>\n<li>Communicate with <em>lots </em>of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIs</li>\n<li>Provide JSON APIs for our customers to build on top of</li>\n<li>Use git for version control, build features in branches, and take turns reviewing pull requests</li>\n<li>Run everything on cloud infrastructure</li>\n<li>Rely on service providers for devops as much as possible (Heroku, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><div><strong><br>Some benefits of working at OpenPlay</strong></div><ul>\n<li>Starting salary 100-155k depending on experience</li>\n<li>Medical, dental, and vision insurance</li>\n<li>Whatever tools, services, books, etc you need to do your job</li>\n<li>Low stress environment: The industry we’re in is comparatively low scale and high value. While we work with lots of data we avoid some of the technical issues and constant urgency you might find with consumer applications.</li>\n<li>Good work/life balance: We expect that everyone works full time (40 hours/week). We do sometimes have deadlines and we haven’t always limited scope appropriately. The last time we worked late nights was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks. Our most recent deadline we met two weeks early.</li>\n<li>Flexible work and vacation schedule. You are free to work the hours that work best for you (outside of our scheduled meetings) and we don’t have a set limit on vacation days.</li>\n<li>Free to work remote. We’ve been doing remote work as long as we’ve been around and our process is built around it. Some of our team is permanently remote, others work out of the office part time.</li>\n<li>Office near the beach in Santa Monica you can use any time.</li>\n<li>Free lunch at nearby restaurants when you’re in the office. Some of which are delicious.</li>\n</ul><div><strong><br>How to apply</strong></div><div>\n<br>Send us your resume! Include a cover letter to add additional details and context if you feel so inclined. We’re mostly looking for two things:</div><ul>\n<li>Prior work experience that looks like it might be a good match for what you’ll be doing at OpenPlay.</li>\n<li>Some understanding of how to program <em>well</em>. Maybe a computer science degree or other academic background. Code contributions you can point to. Blog articles you wrote. A particularly enlightening reddit comment.</li>\n</ul><div>We’d love to know a bit about you as well but it can be a challenging prospect for an initial job application. Feel free to include anything else you’d like, but don’t worry too much about it, we’re mostly looking for the above qualifications at this point.<br><br>\n</div><div>We look forward to hearing from you, good luck on your job search wherever it leads, and thank  you for considering joining OpenPlay!<br><br>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/openplay-full-stack-ruby-engineer\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/openplay-full-stack-ruby-engineer</a></p>\n","pubDate":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 00:25:08 +0000","expires_at":"Sun, 07 Jan 2024 00:25:08 +0000","link":"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/openplay-full-stack-ruby-engineer"},{"title":"OpenCraft: Senior Open Source Developer & DevOps (Python, Django, React, AWS/OpenStack)","region":"Anywhere in the World","category":"Full-Stack Programming","type":"Full-Time","description":"<img src=\"https://we-work-remotely.imgix.net/logos/0017/3489/logo.gif?ixlib=rails-4.0.0&w=50&h=50&dpr=2&fit=fill&auto=compress\" />\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Fully remote company (worldwide, incorporated in Berlin)\n    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href=\"https://opencraft.com/\">https://opencraft.com/</a>\n</p>\n\n<div>Do you care about contributing to open-source, and appreciate a good challenge?

For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</div><div>\n<br>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!).

We aim for long-term relationships -- once in, almost all team members stay for many years. </div><div><br></div><div>We care about paying fairly: </div><ul>\n<li>Team members set their own compensation level, which is paid based on hours worked (no unpaid overtime!). </li>\n<li>When determining your rate, we will expect you to factor in benefits (vacation, healthcare, purchase budgets, etc.) - the idea is to let <em>you</em> pick the benefits that are useful to you, rather than offer one-size-fits-all packages that aren’t always very valuable.</li>\n<li>We also proactively apply generous raises team-wide, based on the company results at the end of each year. <a href=\"https://handbook.opencraft.com/en/latest/team_compensation/\">See the details about how we approach compensation in our handbook</a>.</li>\n</ul><div>We also firmly believe in work-life balance: as long as you deliver what you commit to, there is a lot of latitude in how much work you can choose to accept. We are open to time commitments anywhere in the 30h to 40h/week range, and highly discourage working more than that. It’s important to have time to ourselves, as well as having some slack, and there are diminishing returns in working more anyway.
