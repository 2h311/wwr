It doesn\u2019t have to be pages long and can be very short and concise. But, as a developer, it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates' time.</li>\n<li>There must be some overlap in our working hours so you can respond to urgent requests (if any) or chat with your manager or any of our departments on demand if they have an IT question. This means that some extra tasks may arise during the week.</li>\n<li>You might have a day where one of our team members needs something urgent and needs it done the same or the next day, which can be valuable to the company, or a major issue needs to be fixed ASAP, in which case you might have to drop what you're working on and work on that.

The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data. The Seeq platform is enhanced by Python libraries and Jupyter notebooks to enable extensibility and data science workflows.
